    - Helps install/uninstall 3rd party libraries
    - Dependencies Tracking
    - Package Groups
    - Versions
`pip install SomePackage`
- ipython
    - Robust interactive shell

## Python2 vs Python3

| Python2                       | Python3                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| pip, python, ipython          | pip3, python3, ipython3           |
| `pip install`                 | `pip3 install ipython`            |
| Maintained but no new feature | New features being added          |
| End of Life in 2020           | Unicode support by default        |
| Still default on many systems | Cleared some python2 confusion    |
| Print “Hello World”           | Print (“Hello World”)             |
|                               | Minor differences from python2    |

## How can we execute python code?
- Interpreter - executing python file using python exe
- REPL - Call out to Python code within interactive REPL
- Natively - “Compile and Run” (py2exe, pyinstaller, etc.)

## What are python IDEs?
- idle
- PyCharm
